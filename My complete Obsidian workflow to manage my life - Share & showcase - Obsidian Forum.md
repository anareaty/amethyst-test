As I promised to quite a few people on different places, I‚Äôm releasing a full blown guide of my Obsidian workflow. It has many cool features that I‚Äôve seen people struggling with online :

1. Tasks and project management with journaling, workout logging and media tracking. Using daily and periodic notes.
2. Read-it-later with automated conversion to markdown and import inside your vault. Meaning all your past knowledge is inside Obsidian, available with a simple search alongside your notes.
3. Fast and simple one click upload obsidian publish alternative.

But there‚Äôs plenty more. It took me some time here and there during the past year to come up with this setup. And don‚Äôt worry, it is **easy to use** despite its awfully long name. But I‚Äôll describe it with as much depth as I can for people who wants to fine tune it.

Obviously, it is merely just a starting point, with Obsidian you can (and you always should) do something that works well for **you**. And that means creating your **own** setup. But that doesn‚Äôt forbid you from using this one as a starting-point.

Hello [@RedeyeFR](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/redeyefr) and thanks for sharing! I‚Äôm very interested in your workflow as I‚Äôm trying to set up a very similar one for tasks; I‚Äôm especially interested in your todoist/obsidian tasks plugin approach. If I understand correctly you jot down your tasks on the way in todoist and then how do you transform in obsidian tasks? Or am I wrong?  
Thanks for any advice !

Hi there ! Yup, I‚Äôm using todoist as a quick way to input things I don‚Äôt want to forget.

Then during the day I go on my daily note which has a todoist code block thanks to the obsidian-todoist plugin and I can see my inbox. From there I used to copy these task manually by selecting them and creating various stuff (tasks, projects, notes, etc).

But right now I have quite a more‚Ä¶ Complete approach ? I‚Äôm using the quickadd plugin and a [script 8](https://quickadd.obsidian.guide/docs/Examples/Capture%5FFetchTasksFromTodoist) that allows me to automatically import all of these inside my vault.

I did not and still do not have time to update the template workflow but I made some significant improvement over the last few months based on reviews and on my personal usage that grew. But one day‚Ä¶ 

Wow [@RedeyeFR](https://forum.obsidian.md/u/redeyefr), it worked like a charm!!! And it‚Äôs perfect for my workflow. Just one thing I‚Äôd like to keep, in some cases, the tasks in Todoist and tried to see the code to remove the function call to `closeSelectedtask` but as I have no experience with js script I don‚Äôt know which part of the script I have to cut off (there‚Äôre three lines where it appears, I think‚Ä¶)  
merci beaucoup 

Hey there, glad it helped ! You can copy and paste another script that you‚Äôll use, remove all `closeSelectedTasks` function calls and it should be alright I guess.
