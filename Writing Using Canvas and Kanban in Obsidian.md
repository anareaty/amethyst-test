## Obsidian now contains a set of tools that are quite similar — at least in part — to what Scrintal or Scrivener offers to researchers and writers.

I’ve written in the past about using the Kanban plug-in in Obsidian as a support for writing: see [_Card-Based Writing in Obsidian Using Kanban_](https://medium.com/workings/card-based-writing-in-obsidian-using-kanban-6a7a64c93f5c). I described the use of the Kanban as a means to aggregate materials for my [_Work Futures_](http://workfutures.io/) newsletter:

> When I find something to add to the newsletter, I often want to add commentary, so I might export the original material to a new note, which a/ leaves behind a link from the daily note to the new text, and b/ then I make comments. Then I return to the kanban workboard, and transclude the new file into a kanban card. For long texts I would select the initial paragraph in a transclusion like `![[Sull and Sull - Great Resignation#^15f708]]]`.

> I can use the drag and drop features of the Kanban plugin to reorder cards in a list or move from one list to another, for example.

> A kanban workboard can be manipulated and viewed as either a kanban workboard or as a general markdown file, so I can also edit the markdown file. I can always click through to the source texts if I need to correct an error or follow a link.

I’ve added some other mechanics to my process, and I am now also ending up in an Obsidian canvas to work on the final story I’m writing.

For each story — in this case, a piece for the Sunsama newsletter titled _Getting Tasks Finished_ — I start early in the process with a tiered Kanban: most of the Kanban cards are material I am considering for the piece, along with a child Kanban with a checklist for the project:

Getting Tasks Finished Kanban

Note that the checklist at the top is a child Kanban, transcluded into the parent _Getting Tasks Finished_ Kanban. Even transcluded, the tasks in the checklist can be checked off to indicate the state of the project. I made the folder with the parent and child Kanbans using the _Enhance Copy Note_ which can make a copy of a folder and its contents, and I have created a template folder for that purpose. (I do have to manually rename the folder and elements.)

The Kanban acts as a good repository, and I can open any of the links if I want using the link icon. But when I get around to actually writing, I take another step, and use the _Link Exploder_ plugin to create a canvas from the parent Kanban.

The Kanban exploded into the Canvas

I will zoom into some of the sections.

Here you can see the checklist Kanban, which displays in markdown mode, as before. Note that it can be edited on the canvas. There is also a group of cards I created directly on the canvas where I considered ordering the materials in sections for the story.

The Canvas

The _Link Exploder_ pulled in all the transcluded material I had accumulated for the story as notes _from the vault_, and linked them all on the canvas to the parent Kanban. I shifted some links and moved elements around, thinking about the organization of the story:

I manually pulled in the file I’d created for the story (from the same folder), and wrote the piece while it was displayed on the canvas, going back and forth from the various materials for quotes, links, and concepts.

The final document at the right with research materials in the center.

I submitted the story to the production team at Sunsama (where I am the Philosopher of Work, a kind of thinker-in-residence role), which entailed copying and pasting the file to another system, outside of Obsidian.

The final step was to check the _in review_ task in the checklist.

## Observations

The process works well, but there are things that could make it better.

Once I have exploded the Kanban onto the canvas, editing the various files that make up the kanbanilized materials works perfectly, since they are references to the files, not copies. Checking the _in review_ task, for example, changes the state of the task in the checklist, which is exactly as it should be. However, when I added a quote on the canvas as a note, it was orphaned there. I could manually convert that note to a file in the vault, save it somewhere appropriate, and move ahead. But there is no way (yet, at least) to implode all the various notes on a canvas into a Kanban. I’m not sure that is a real problem, though.

Certainly, someone somewhere might want to collate all the notes captured on a canvas brainstorming or planning session onto a Kanban, but in my usage here I already had a Kanban.

And someone who wants to avoid the use of a Kanban during the note-gathering phase might instead opt to populate the canvas with notes rather than using a Kanban, although I like the drag-and-drop in Kanban, and across Kanban boards. For example, I often collect links to webpages in my _inbox_ Kanban, before I have determined whether I will be including it in a story, and later on, I can drag it from a Kanban in one Obsidian window to a second Kanban in another. I don’t think that’s possible on canvases.

At any rate, the process works very well, and now I can say that Obsidian now contains a set of tools that are quite similar — at least in part — to what Scrintal or Scrivener offers to researchers and writers.
